    "\n",
    "*  Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases\n",
    "\n",
    "    - SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to store and organize data. They have a well-defined schema, which defines the structure of the data, the relationships between tables, and the constraints that ensure data integrity. SQL databases are based on a set of standardized SQL commands, which are used to insert, update, and query data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that do not use tables to store data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document-oriented, graph, or column-family. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, and they can handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data."
