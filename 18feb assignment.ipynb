    "--> APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the weather bureau's software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* example:- Google map + Uber\n",
    "\n",
    " Google Maps is using Uber’s API to request information by sending a HTTP request function with the start and end points of the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber’s API then sends information back such as how many cars are available, where are they currently located, and the costs for the various ride options.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is then processed by Google Maps and is available to the user directly linking them the the Uber app if it is previously downloaded."

    "an integration:- An example of an integration is to push notifications from your product (such as CRM, Helpdesk) to a messaging tool such as Slack. In this way, if your customer uses Slack they can receive notifications without having to login directly to your system or check emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "new functionality:- In the early days of Twitter, some of the most popular Twitter clients were produced by third parties using the Twitter API. Twitter and its users benefited from the new functionality that was undertaken by other companies.\n",

Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. \n",

    "\n",

    "* Since it uses XML format, SOAP is considered to be a slow platform because the payload is large for a simple string message.\n",

    "* SOAP is hard to test in browsers.\n",
